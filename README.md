It typically includes visual reports on employee performance, recruitment pipelines, retention rates, diversity and inclusion, training effectiveness, and overall employee engagement. By integrating data from multiple HR systems, the dashboard provides real-time insights, helping HR leaders make informed decisions, identify trends, predict future challenges, and optimize workforce strategies to enhance productivity, employee satisfaction, and organizational success.
